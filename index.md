This site aims to be a comprehensive guide to the Ontotext Recommendation engine. We will cover topics such as getting the engine up and running, ingesting content into the system, logging user actions, tuning the recommendation algorithm, scaling, and deployment.

## Who is this site for?

This is a technical documentation, written to be used by technical people as a complete reference. We also try to provide as much as possible insight into what we are currently working on and our future ideas via the roadmap page, and will keep you posted with news about releases and upgrade paths.

## What is the Concept API?

The Concept API is the part of the Ontotext Publishing Platform resopnsible for operations with RDF Objects such as Concepts (or named entities), Documents and Channels. We view every RDF object as a concept, thence the API name.
