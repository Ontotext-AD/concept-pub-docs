It is also a common practice for us to organize Skype chats and/or custom mailing lists for each of our clients.

# Why do it this way?

We know it would be nice to have a place where our users share insights, but we haven't set up one yet.
One of the main reasons not to do it is due to the fact that we work with publishers and their data is sensitive, so they can't freely give examples. Instead, we try to
raise visibility by updating our <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/v1_1_0-docs/faq/">FAQ</a> and <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/v1_1_0-docs/known-issues/">Known Issues</a> pages, as well as the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/roadmap/">Roadmap</a> to show what we're currently working on.
